# Exercise 6: Futures

We have a User Service using a repository with asynchronous calls. We need to implement the delete method following the next steps:

1. Check if the user exists.
   If the user does'nt exist, throw an error with the message "User not found"
2. Remove the phone lines associated
3. Remove the user associated
4. Return the user deleted

Check your response running the tests
